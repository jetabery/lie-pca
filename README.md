This project explores the problem of recovering the underlying Lie group that describes the symmetries of a dataset distributed near a one-dimensional manifold embedded in a Euclidean space. The core idea is to reconstruct the action of the group from discrete orbit samples.

## Key Ideas
- **Best-Case Scenario:**  
  The dataset is generated by the action of a 1-torus $T$ on a point in $\mathbb{C}^d$, evenly sampled and with the ordering preserved. Recovery is performed through Fourier analysis and projection onto subrepresentations of the group.

- **Unordered Data:**  
  If the dataset is reordered by an element of the dihedral group, the recovered Lie group remains unchanged.

- **Non-Uniform Sampling:**  
  If points are sampled non-uniformly, the problem reduces to a kernel-based estimation problem using Sinkhorn's algorithm.

- **Noise Robustness:**  
  The method is theoretically robust to noise (proof pending).

## Next Steps
- Generalize to higher-dimensional orbits
- Prove noise robustness
- Explore applications in machine learning and data augmentation
