This project explores the problem of recovering the representation of the Lie group (the 1-Torus) that describes the symmetries of a dataset distributed near a one-dimensional manifold embedded in a Euclidean space. 

## Key Ideas
- **Best-Case Scenario:**  
  The dataset is generated by the action of a representation of the 1-torus $\mathbb{T}$ on a point in $\mathbb{C}^d$, evenly sampled and with the ordering preserved. Recovery is performed through a discrete Fourier transform yielding projections onto subrepresentations of the group.

- **Unordered Data:**  
  If the dataset is reordered by an element of the dihedral group, the recovered Lie group remains unchanged.
  If the dataset is reordered by an arbitrary permutation, the original ordering may often be reconstructed (modulo the dihedral group) using the spectral properties of a heat diffusion kernel matrix, combined with Sinkhorn's algorithm.

- **Non-Uniform Sampling:**  
  If points are sampled non-uniformly, the kernel-based estimation problem using Sinkhorn's algorithm may still yield useful results (this should be explored further).

- **Noise Robustness:**  
  Empirically, the method appears robust to some amount of noise (proof pending).

## Next Steps
- Generalize to other Lie groups, especially higher-dimensional tori (Since there is also well-developed Fourier analysis on $\mathbb{T}^n$)
- Prove noise robustness
- Explore applications in machine learning and density estimation
- Explore the possibility of discovering analytic periodic solutions to the 3 Body Problem using these tools
